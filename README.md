# Paul's Personal Python Programming Pet Project

## About
Python is a general-purpose, dynamically compiled programming language. It is used for everything from web programming, creating desktop applications and game development.

## Set Up
In order to get started with Python, you first must install it. You can download it directly from Terminal using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/); however, if you are on a Mac,you will need to first download [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). You have an option either to download Python 2 (legacy version) or Python 3. I decided to download and work with the latest version of Python, version 3.6.4.

Once you have homebrew installed, enter the following into Terminal. 

```
 brew install python3 
```

You are ready to get started!

## Hello World
To begin coding in Python, create a new file with a '.py' file extension. I named mine 'hello_world.py', since I will simply writing a Python block to print 'hello world' to the console.

Enter the following code in your file:

```python
  print("hello world")
```

Now, to run this code, simply enter the following into your Terminal:

```
 python [your_filename]
```

You should see the text 'hello world" print to your console!
